DO!
* If you ever get lost in terminal and don't know where you are just type: pwd
* If you want to know which version of python you are running just type: which python


DO NOT!
* Using anaconda. I know it is easy and they have everything but believe me use anaconda only if you know which python you are running from where.
It is really easy to get lost for beginners and might cause trouble with packages / weird error messages. That's the why
we create a virtual environment to test. It is clean!
* Ask questions on the video. It might take days or even years for me to answer ( Not a YouTube regular! ). Instead Email me :)
* Panic and drink too much Coffee if you are not able to install it. We are here to help :)
