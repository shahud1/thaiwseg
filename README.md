# DID YOU KNOW? (v1.0)

Group T10 was the only group who made both Word segmentation and POS tagging

Need a perfect word segmenter? use our program! It is much better than any dictionary based method!

 It gives you both Deepcut and PythaiNLP ( The best in the biz ) so you can choose any method that you want! How cool is that?

Group T10 had so much to show but due to the limited time we were able to show only a fraction of the whole.

Group T10 is ready to do the presentation again and explain in detail if needed!

This algorithm POS tags at 90k words/second. Whoa! Thatâ€™s fast!

Group T10 spent weeks for preparing and selection of the best algorithm for the best result!
